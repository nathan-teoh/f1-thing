## What is this? 
Honestly at this point I don't know. All I know is, it is written in Rust, it uses Tokio, it hits [Ergast Api](https://ergast.com/) and also implements the tables outlined in the documentaiton. 

## Future plans?
Okay to be completely honest I'm doing this because I'm also going through [An Introduction to Statistical Learning](https://www.statlearning.com/) as well, in order to kinda freshened up my data sciencey knowledge and skills. Thought it would be interesting to see what I end up with when I combined different things that I love. 

So! Ideally, at some point, in the not too distant future, this will have functionality to retrieve data from Ergast, store it in a local database, and offer it up as a consumable API (just for myself, don't worry Ergast). Then, I'd like to write up a site that consumes that API and displays information in a cool way. Idk, I **really** hate web dev. 

Thank you,
